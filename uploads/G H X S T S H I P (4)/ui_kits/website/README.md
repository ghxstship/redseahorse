# GHXSTSHIP — Brand Kit (Vintage Reef)

The GHXSTSHIP brand & marketing system. **Positioning:** the General Contractor, Foreman & Procore of
experiential projects — Production Management, Operations Leadership, Technology Implementation.
**Aesthetic:** "Vintage Reef" — premium vintage-tropical (charcoal-graphite reef grounds; jade =
Production, pineapple = Operations, sapphire = Technology). **Voice:** Yacht Builder + Expedition
Creator (light texture, never corny).

This kit is **independent of the ATLVS product kit** — no shared stylesheets. (See `../atlvs/` for the
SaaS product system, which is self-contained on `product-theme.css`.)

## Stylesheets (source of truth)
- `colors_and_type.css` — tokens (Vintage Reef colors, type, spacing, soft elevation) + `.gx-*` type classes.
- `components.css` — premium components: buttons, tags, panels, cards, inputs, links.
- `terminal.css` — structural parts (strip-map, departures, gate, boarding pass) — legacy support; the
  live homepage uses the journey×GC layout.
- `polish.css` — motion (scroll-reveal with visibility fail-safe), focus rings, density.

## Pages
- `index.html` — **the homepage**: journey×GC layout. Sticky journey rail
  (The Destination → The Ship → The Course → The Crew → The Manifest → Launch), numbers band,
  positioning band, capability stack (GC/Foreman/Procore), the Course (8-phase XPMS strip-map),
  Selected Work (The Log), CTA, footer. Cycling porthole media player in the hero.
- `destinations/*.html` — 6 vertical SEO/GEO pages (festival, concert-tour, brand-activations,
  immersive, sporting, tv-film-broadcast).
- `resources/glossary.html` · `work/salvage-city-supper-club.html` · `locations.html` ·
  `sitemap.xml` · `robots.txt`.
